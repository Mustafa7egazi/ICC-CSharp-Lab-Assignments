# ICC C# Lab Assignments

Welcome to the **ICC C# Lab Assignments** repository! This repo contains my daily tasks and solutions for the C# programming labs as part of the **Intensive Code Camp (ICC)** organized by the **Information Technology Institute (ITI)**. Each day’s task is implemented using **Visual Studio** and organized into separate folders for easy access.

## About
This repository is a collection of C# programming assignments completed during the ICC program at ITI. The goal is to practice and enhance my skills in C# development through daily tasks. Each assignment is solved as a standalone project or solution within this repo.

## Structure
- **Daily Tasks**: Each folder represents a specific day or task (e.g., `Day01`, `Day02`, etc.).
- **Solutions**: Inside each folder, you’ll find the Visual Studio solution (`.sln`) file along with the source code (`.cs` files) and any additional resources used.

## Tools Used
- **Language**: C#  
- **IDE**: Visual Studio (latest version)  
- **Framework**: .NET (specify version if applicable, e.g., .NET 6 or .NET 8)
