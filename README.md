# ICC C# Lab Assignments

Welcome to the **ICC C# Lab Assignments** repository! This repo contains my daily tasks and solutions for the C# programming labs as part of the **Intensive Code Camp (ICC)** organized by the **Information Technology Institute (ITI)**. Each dayâ€™s task is implemented using **Visual Studio** and organized into separate folders for easy access.

## About
This repository is a collection of C# programming assignments completed during the ICC program at ITI. The goal is to practice and enhance my skills in C# development through daily tasks. Each assignment is solved as a standalone project or solution within this repo.

## Structure
- **Daily Tasks**: Each folder represents a specific day or task (e.g., `Day01`, `Day02`, etc.).
- **Solutions**: Inside each folder, youâ€™ll find the Visual Studio solution (`.sln`) file along with the source code (`.cs` files) and any additional resources used.

## Tools Used
- **Language**: C#  
- **IDE**: Visual Studio (latest version)  
- **Framework**: .NET (.NET 8)

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/ICC-CSharp-Lab-Assignments.git
   ```
2. Open the desired daily folder (e.g., `Day02`).
3. Open the `.sln` file in Visual Studio.
4. Build and run the solution to see the output.

**Note**: The code is divided into regions with comments for better organization and readability. If you want to run a specific region, make sure to uncomment that region first in the `.cs` files before running the solution.

## Contributions
This is a personal project for learning purposes as part of my ITI training. Feel free to explore the code, but contributions are not expected at this time.
